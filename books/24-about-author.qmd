# About the Author {.unnumbered}

**Algimantas Krasauskas** is a software engineer and technologist exploring the boundaries of AI-generated content. This book is an experimental project—not the result of years of traditional scholarship, but a **2-day demonstration** of what modern Large Language Models can achieve when properly guided.

**Background**: Coming from a technical background rather than academic religious studies, I approached this project as an AI capability test: Could AI synthesize complex historical and theological analysis that would traditionally require decades of specialized training? The answer appears to be "partially, with significant human oversight."

**The Experiment**: This book demonstrates AI-human collaboration in research:
- AI systems handled source analysis (including texts in Arabic, Turkish, and Latin I cannot read)
- I provided intellectual frameworks, curated outputs, and verified claims
- The result is neither pure AI generation nor traditional scholarship, but something experimental

**Intellectual Honesty**: I am not an Islamic scholar, Middle East historian, or counter-terrorism expert. I am a person curious about both extremism and AI capabilities, testing whether the latter can help democratize understanding of the former.

**Dedic**ation**: This work is dedicated to Justina Krasauskienė, whose support made this experiment possible, and to everyone curious about the future of AI-augmented research.
