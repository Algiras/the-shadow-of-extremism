# The Colonial Wound: 1924 and the Brotherhood

**The man who created modern terrorism was not a warlord, a cleric, or a revolutionary. He was a 22-year-old schoolteacher.**

## Key Takeaways

**The Big Idea**: The modern Middle East's borders are artificial colonial constructs, and political Islam (Islamism) emerged as a reaction to the psychological and political vacuum left by the Caliphate's abolition.

**Key Insights**:
- **Sykes-Picot (1916)** drew the map without regard for ethnic realities.
- **1924 (Caliphate Abolition)** was the "psychological decapitation" of the Ummah.
- **The Muslim Brotherhood (1928)** was founded to fill this void, starting as a grassroots welfare society.

**The Cycle Connection**: The "Colonial Wound" serves as the **Crisis Phase** that triggers the search for a rigid, purifying identity.

**Counterintuitive Insight**: The Muslim Brotherhood didn't start as a terror group; it started as a youth club and welfare society—essentially "Boy Scouts with a Quran."

In 1928, a young Egyptian named Hassan al-Banna gathered six workers in a tea house in Ismailia and founded the Muslim Brotherhood. He had no army, no wealth, and no political power. Yet within two decades, his organization would become the ideological blueprint for every major Islamist movement of the 20th century—from Hamas to Al-Qaeda to ISIS.

But al-Banna didn't invent extremism. He was reacting to a trauma that had shaken the Muslim world to its core four years earlier: the abolition of the Caliphate. The transition from the medieval to the modern was not a gradual evolution for the Middle East; it was a violent rupture. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the subsequent colonial partition did not just redraw borders—it dismantled the political psyche of the Muslim world, creating a vacuum that radical movements rushed to fill.

## The Sick Man Dies: 1918-1924

By the early 20th century, the Ottoman Empire was the "Sick Man of Europe," crumbling under debt, nationalism, and war. Its decision to side with Germany in World War I was its death knell.

### Sykes-Picot and the Betrayal
In 1916, while British officers like T.E. Lawrence were promising Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against the Turks, British and French diplomats (Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot) were secretly carving up the region with a ruler on a map.

*   **Artificial Borders**: The agreement created states like "Iraq" and "Syria" with little regard for ethnic or sectarian realities, forcing Kurds, Sunnis, and Shias into fragile national containers. The borders were drawn not around historical communities but around colonial interests—oil fields, trade routes, and strategic ports.

*   **The Mandate System**: Instead of independence, the Arabs got "Mandates"—a polite term for colonization. This betrayal is a cornerstone of the modern grievance narrative; ISIS famously bulldozed the border berm between Iraq and Syria in 2014, declaring the "End of Sykes-Picot."^[Fromkin, David. *A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East*. Henry Holt and Co., 1989. The definitive account of how European powers reshaped the region.]

### The Sykes-Picot Timeline: How the Map Was Drawn

**1915-1916: The Promises**
*   **Hussein-McMahon Correspondence**: The British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon, writes to Sharif Hussein of Mecca, promising Arab independence in exchange for revolt against the Ottomans.
*   **May 1916**: The secret Sykes-Picot Agreement is signed. France gets Syria and Lebanon. Britain gets Iraq and Palestine. Russia (soon to collapse) gets parts of Anatolia.

**1917: The Balfour Declaration**

*   Britain promises a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine—the same land they just promised to the Arabs.

**1920: The Mask Comes Off**

*   At the San Remo Conference, the "Mandates" are formalized. The Arabs realize they've been betrayed.
*   **Faisal's Short-Lived Kingdom**: Faisal ibn Hussein (who fought alongside Lawrence of Arabia) briefly declares a kingdom in Syria. The French crush it within months and install him as a puppet king in Iraq instead.

**The Legacy**: The borders created in 1920 are the borders wars are fought over today. Sykes-Picot is not just history—it's the blueprint for modern chaos.

## The 1953 Iran Coup: The Root of Anti-Americanism

If Sykes-Picot explains anti-British sentiment, the 1953 coup in Iran explains anti-American rage.

### The Backstory: Oil and Democracy
In 1951, Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister **Mohammad Mosaddegh** nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), which had been extracting Iranian oil while giving Iran a pittance in royalties.

*   **The British Reaction**: Britain imposed sanctions and plotted a coup. They asked the U.S. for help.
*   **The American Calculation**: President Eisenhower feared that if Mosaddegh wasn't removed, Iran might turn communist (aligning with the Soviet Union). The CIA and MI6 launched **Operation Ajax**.

### August 19, 1953: The Coup

*   **The Plan**: The CIA bribed military officers, organized street protests, and paid thugs to create chaos, blaming it on Mosaddegh.
*   **The Result**: Mosaddegh was overthrown. The young Shah (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) was reinstalled as an absolute monarch.
*   **The Reward**: American and British oil companies got control of Iranian oil.

### The Consequences

*   **The Shah's Dictatorship**: For 25 years, the Shah ruled as a brutal autocrat, backed by the CIA and armed by the U.S. His secret police (SAVAK) tortured dissidents.
*   **The 1979 Revolution**: The rage that had been building for decades exploded. The Shah was overthrown. The U.S. Embassy was seized. Ayatollah Khomeini came to power, declaring America the "Great Satan."

**The Lesson**: When extremists shout "Death to America," they are not rejecting American values (freedom, democracy). They are rejecting American hypocrisy—overthrowing a democracy to install a dictator, all for oil.

### The Abolition of the Caliphate
On March 3, 1924, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the secular founder of modern Turkey, formally abolished the Caliphate. For the first time in 1,300 years, there was no Commander of the Faithful.

The shock was profound. The poet Shawqi lamented, *"The wedding songs have turned to dirges."* To many, it felt like the religion itself had been orphaned. The abolition wasn't just a political act—it was symbolic decapitation. Without a Caliph, who speaks for Islam? Who defends the *Ummah*? This vacuum would be exploited by every extremist group from the Muslim Brotherhood to ISIS.

### The Psychological Impact
The colonial period inflicted not just political but psychological trauma:

*   **Cultural Humiliation**: Western powers occupied holy cities (Jerusalem, Mecca's protectors were gone).

*   **Economic Exploitation**: Resources (oil, cotton) were extracted to enrich colonial metropoles.

*   **Intellectual Colonization**: Western education systems replaced traditional *madrasas*, creating a generation alienated from both worlds—not Western enough for the colonizers, not Muslim enough for the traditionalists.

This dual alienation created the perfect breeding ground for reactive ideologies that rejected both Western modernity and Islamic tradition, seeking instead to "purify" Islam back to an imagined Golden Age.

## The Reaction: Hassan al-Banna and the Brotherhood

In 1928, four years after the Caliphate's end, a 22-year-old schoolteacher named **Hassan al-Banna** founded the **Muslim Brotherhood** (*Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimun*) in Ismailia, Egypt.

Al-Banna was horrified by the British occupation and the "cultural colonization" he saw in Egypt—the bars, the brothels, the secular schools. But he was equally disturbed by the passivity of traditional religious leaders, the *ulama*, who seemed content to let Islam wither into private piety.

### The Brotherhood's Mission
Al-Banna did not initially call for violence. His slogan was *"Islam is the Solution."* He believed that before the Caliphate could be restored politically, it had to be restored in the hearts of individuals.

*   **Grassroots Islamism**: The Brotherhood built schools, clinics, and scout troops. They filled the gap left by the state, creating a "state within a state." By providing social services, they earned loyalty from the poor and disenfranchised—a model later copied by Hamas, Hezbollah, and others.

*   **The Secret Apparatus**: While Al-Banna preached reform, a clandestine wing of the Brotherhood (*Al-Jihaz al-Khass*) began assassinating British officials and Egyptian collaborators. This dual strategy—public charity, covert violence—became the Brotherhood's hallmark.^[Mitchell, Richard P. *The Society of the Muslim Brothers*. Oxford University Press, 1969. Mitchell's work remains the standard reference for the early history of the Brotherhood.]

### The Ideology: Islam as Total System
Al-Banna's genius was to reframe Islam not as a religion but as a *deen*—a comprehensive system governing all aspects of life: politics, economics, law, and culture. He argued:

*   **Islam is not just prayer and fasting**; it is a political constitution.

*   **The West is not just militarily superior**; it is morally bankrupt.

*   **Muslims must not just resist occupation**; they must rebuild the Caliphate.

This ideology was revolutionary. It transformed Islam from a spiritual tradition into a political manifesto. The Brotherhood's credo encapsulated this vision:
> *"Allah is our objective. The Prophet is our leader. The Quran is our law. Jihad is our way. Dying in the way of Allah is our highest hope."*

### Al-Banna's Assassination and Legacy
Al-Banna was assassinated in 1949 by Egyptian security forces. He left behind a powerful organization, but one with a fractured soul.

#### The Radical Shift: From Al-Banna to Mashhur
It is crucial to distinguish between the founder's vision and what the Brotherhood became. Al-Banna's jihad was primarily **nationalist and anti-colonial**—aimed at expelling the British from Egypt and Zionists from Palestine.

The shift to **global jihad** came later, hardened by decades of torture in Nasser's prisons and the influence of the Afghan Jihad. This evolution is epitomized by the 1995 manifesto **"Jihad is the Way"** (*Al-Jihad huwa al-Sabil*). Often mistakenly attributed to Al-Banna due to its title mirroring the Brotherhood's slogan, this text was actually written by **Mustafa Mashhur**, the movement's fifth General Guide.

*   **Al-Banna (1940s)**: Focused on purifying the Muslim individual and liberating Muslim land.
*   **Mashhur (1995)**: Explicitly called for global conquest and the restoration of the Caliphate through martial means, bridging the gap between the Brotherhood's political Islam and Al-Qaeda's global terror.

Every modern Islamist group, from Hamas to Al-Qaeda, shares DNA with the Brotherhood, but they are often children of Mashhur's radicalism as much as Al-Banna's revivalism.

*   **Hamas** is the Palestinian branch of the Brotherhood.
*   **Sayyid Qutb**, the ideologue of Al-Qaeda, was a Brotherhood member radicalized in prison.
*   **Osama bin Laden** studied Brotherhood texts in Saudi Arabia.

They are the children of 1924, orphans of the Caliphate seeking to rebuild their father's house. But the tools they use—*Takfir*, sectarianism, and indiscriminate violence—are mutations of the original design.

## The Colonial Wound Today

The colonial period ended legally with independence in the 1940s-60s, but psychologically, it never ended. The grievances are real:

*   **Borders remain artificial**, fueling ethnic and sectarian conflict.

*   **Dictatorships** (often Western-backed) replaced colonial governors.

*   **Economic dependency** on the West persists through oil, arms, and debt.

Extremists weaponize this trauma, arguing that the only solution is to reject the entire post-colonial order—nation-states, democracy, secularism—and return to the Caliphate. They are not wrong that the wound is deep. They are wrong that more blood will heal it.
