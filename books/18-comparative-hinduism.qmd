# The Saffron Wave: Hindutva and the Mob^[The title "The Saffron Wave" pays homage to Thomas Blom Hansen's seminal work *The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindu Nationalism in Modern India* (Princeton University Press, 1999), which remains the definitive academic study of the BJP and RSS's rise to power.]

In the Indian subcontinent, the shadow of extremism takes a different form. It is not the lone wolf of ISIS or the militia of the LRA; it is the **Mob**.

The rise of **Hindutva** (Hindu nationalism) demonstrates how a pluralistic democracy can be hijacked by majoritarian extremism. The goal is not a theocracy in the Abrahamic sense, but an ethno-state where religious identity determines citizenship.

## The Ideological Foundation: Savarkar and the RSS

To understand the violence, we must understand the philosophy. The term "Hindutva" was coined not by a priest, but by an atheist revolutionary: **Vinayak Damodar Savarkar**.

### Savarkar's Manifesto: *Essentials of Hindutva* (1923)
While imprisoned by the British, Savarkar wrote the foundational text of the movement. He argued that India was not a territorial entity, but a racial and cultural one.

*   **Pitribhumi (Fatherland) & Punyabhumi (Holyland)**: Savarkar defined a Hindu as someone who considers India both their Fatherland and their Holyland.
*   **The Exclusion**: This definition deliberately excluded Muslims and Christians. Their "Holylands" (Mecca, Jerusalem) were outside India, meaning their loyalty was suspect. They could be citizens, but never truly "Indian" in the spiritual sense.

### The RSS: The Army of the Idea
In 1925, **Keshav Baliram Hedgewar** founded the **Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh** (RSS) to operationalize Savarkar's vision.

*   **The Fascist Inspiration**: The RSS's early leaders were explicit admirers of European fascism. **M.S. Golwalkar**, the second Supreme Leader, wrote in 1939:
    > *"To keep up the purity of the Race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of the Semitic Races—the Jews. National pride at its highest has been manifested here... a good lesson for us in Hindustan to learn and profit by."*

This is the DNA of the movement: the belief that a nation is defined by a single race/religion, and that minorities are "foreign bodies" that must be assimilated or excised.

### The RSS Structure: A Hindu Brotherhood
The RSS operates through a unique model that blends boy scouts with paramilitary discipline:

*   **Daily Shakhas** (Branches): Morning drills combining physical exercise (*lathi* stick fighting), martial training, and ideological indoctrination. Children as young as 5 are enrolled.
*   **Hierarchical Structure**: Local shakhas report to regional *pracharaks* (full-time organizers) who report to the *Sarsanghchalak*.
*   **Uniformed Identity**: Members wear khaki shorts and white shirts, deliberately evoking a paramilitary aesthetic.
*   **Oath**: Swear loyalty to the "Hindu nation" above the Indian state.

### The Sangh Parivar: The Family Network
The RSS doesn't operate alone. It spawned a network of affiliate organizations known as the **Sangh Parivar** (Family of the RSS):

*   **VHP (Vishva Hindu Parishad)**: Founded in 1964 to "organize and consolidate Hindu society." Responsible for the Ramjanmabhoomi movement demanding the destruction of Babri Masjid.
*   **Bajrang Dal**: The militant youth wing, known for street violence and intimidation.
*   **BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party)**: The political arm, which has governed India under Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1998-2004) and Narendra Modi (2014-present).

This is the genius of Hindutva: it operates across civil society, culture, and politics simultaneously, making it nearly impossible to confront.

## The Spark: Babri Masjid (1992)

The destruction of the Babri Masjid was not spontaneous; it was the culmination of a **four-year mobilization campaign** orchestrated by the VHP and BJP.

### Timeline of Escalation (1986-1992)

*   **1986**: A district judge orders the unlocking of the Babri Masjid gates, allowing Hindus to worship inside. The VHP launches a movement to "liberate" the site, claiming it is the birthplace of Lord Rama.
*   **1989**: The VHP organizes a *Shila Pujan* (brick worship) campaign. 200,000 consecrated bricks are sent from villages across India to Ayodhya, physically connecting rural Hindus to the cause.
*   **1990**: BJP leader **L.K. Advani** launches the *Rath Yatra* (chariot procession). He travels 10,000 km across India in a Toyota van decorated as a chariot. His speeches trigger riots in every city he passes.
*   **1991**: The BJP wins the state election in Uttar Pradesh (where Ayodhya is located), giving them control of the local police.

### December 6, 1992: The Demolition
On the designated day, **150,000 kar sevaks** (volunteer workers) gathered in Ayodhya. Leaders had publicly promised the Supreme Court that the rally would be peaceful. It was a lie.

At 12:30 PM, the first wave of men climbed the mosque's domes with pickaxes. By 5:00 PM, the 16th-century structure was rubble. BJP leaders watched from a podium, some photographed making victory signs.

The aftermath:

*   **2,000+ killed** in nationwide riots (officially, likely higher)
*   **Mumbai Riots (1992-93)**: Shiv Sena mobs targeted Muslims, killing 900
*   **Mumbai Bombings (1993)**: Retaliatory attacks by Muslim gangster Dawood Ibrahim killed 257

The Indian state did nothing. Not a single leader was convicted.

## The Fire: Gujarat (2002)

If 1992 was a riot, 2002 was a pogrom. It remains the darkest chapter in modern Indian history.

### The Godhra Incident
On February 27, 2002, the **Sabarmati Express** stopped in Godhra station. Carriage S-6 carried Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya. A fire broke out, killing **59 people**, including 25 women and 15 children.

The cause remains disputed:

*   **Official Narrative**: A Muslim mob threw petrol bombs at the train.
*   **Forensic Evidence**: The fire started *inside* the carriage, suggesting an accident (a cooking stove).

The truth no longer mattered. Within hours, the VHP declared it an "Islamic terror attack" and called for a *bandh* (strike). What followed was three days of state-sponsored slaughter.

### The Three Days of Fire: A Minute-by-Minute Anatomy of a Pogrom

**February 28, 2002**
*   **09:00 AM**: Mobs gather in Ahmedabad. They are armed not just with swords, but with **voter lists** identifying Muslim homes and businesses. This indicates premeditation.
*   **11:00 AM**: The mob surrounds the **Gulbarg Society**, a Muslim housing complex where former MP Ehsan Jafri lived. Jafri makes frantic calls to the police and political leaders for help. None arrives.
*   **02:00 PM**: The mob breaches the gates. They drag Jafri out, hack him to pieces, and burn his body. 69 people are killed in this single complex.
*   **04:00 PM**: In Naroda Patiya, a mob of 5,000 attacks a slum. Over 97 people are killed. Women are gang-raped before being burned alive.

**March 1, 2002**
*   **Police Complicity**: Multiple testimonies describe police officers directing mobs to Muslim neighborhoods or standing by while massacres occurred. Some officers reportedly told victims: *"We have no orders to save you."*
*   **Government Role**: Chief Minister **Narendra Modi** allegedly told police to "let Hindus vent their anger" (a claim he denies and was cleared of by a Supreme Court-appointed SIT due to "lack of prosecutable evidence," though many activists dispute this finding).

**The Death Toll**: Official count is 1,044 dead (790 Muslims, 254 Hindus). Independent investigations suggest **2,000+**.

**The Aftermath**: Modi won re-election in 2002 with an increased majority. The polarization worked.

## The New Normal: Cow Vigilantism and "Love Jihad" (2014-Present)

Since the BJP's return to power in 2014, violence has shifted from mass riots to targeted, molecular violence.

### Cow Vigilantism: The Lynch Mob
Hindutva ideology venerates the cow as *Gau Mata* (Mother Cow). Several BJP-ruled states have passed strict anti-cow slaughter laws. But the law is just the surface. Vigilante mobs use "cow protection" as a pretext for terrorizing Muslims and Dalits.

*   **Pehlu Khan (2017)**: Dairy farmer beaten to death while transporting cows with valid permits. His killers were acquitted.
*   **Akhlaq Ahmed (2015)**: Lynched in his home based on a rumor he had beef in his refrigerator (it was mutton).
*   **Junaid Khan (2017)**: 15-year-old stabbed to death on a train for carrying beef (it was food for Eid).

### "Love Jihad": The Legal Weaponization
The most insidious development is the conspiracy theory of **"Love Jihad"**—the idea that Muslim men are seducing Hindu women to convert them to Islam and change India's demographics.

In 2020, the state of Uttar Pradesh passed the **"Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance."**

*   **The Law**: It makes religious conversion for marriage a non-bailable offense.
*   **The Reality**: It gives police the power to arrest interfaith couples. Muslim men marrying Hindu women are routinely jailed, while the women are returned to their parents' custody.
*   **The Message**: The state now polices the bedroom. Religious identity trumps individual choice.

## The Identity + Mob Dynamic

Hindu extremism differs from Islamist extremism in its mechanics but shares its core **Dynamics**:

1.  **Dynamic 1 (Myth of Purity)**: Just as Islamists yearn for the Caliphate, Hindutva yearns for the *Hindu Rashtra* (Hindu Nation)—a golden age before Muslim "invaders" arrived.
2.  **Dynamic 2 (The Trauma)**: The minority (Muslims, 14% of the population) is framed as a demographic threat ("Love Jihad") or a fifth column.
3.  **Dynamic 4 (The Mechanism)**: The Mob becomes the weapon. Violence is decentralized, carried out by vigilante groups (*Gau Rakshaks*) rather than a formal army.
4.  **Dynamic 5 (The Entropy)**: Communal polarization translates into votes, but at the cost of social cohesion and the rule of law.

## The International Parallel

Hindutva shares a disturbing parallel with Buddhist nationalism in Myanmar: both are **democratic extremisms**. The mechanisms are:

1.  **Majority Rule = Mob Rule**: When 80% of the population votes for religious nationalism, constitutional protections become meaningless.
2.  **Civil Society Capture**: NGOs, media, and even academia are infiltrated by ideologues.
3.  **Judicial Capture**: Courts become reluctant to convict co-religionists, especially when mobs threaten judges.

The Saffron Wave proves that democracy is no guarantee against extremism. When the majority decides that the minority does not belong, the ballot box can become as dangerous as the bullet.
