# The "Other": Treatment of Non-Believers

In 2015, Bangladesh sentenced atheist bloggers to jail—for their own protection.

The government argued that by existing publicly, these bloggers were "hurting religious sentiments" and inviting their own murder. This perverse logic—where the victim is guilty of being a target—encapsulates the extremist view of the "Other." Whether it is the Yazidi in Iraq, the Copt in Egypt, or the atheist in Dhaka, the non-believer is not a citizen with rights, but a problem to be managed or eliminated.

**Counterintuitive Insight**: The most dangerous thing you can be in an extremist state is not a Christian or a Jew, but a former Muslim who stopped believing.

## August 3, 2014: The Siege of Kocho

The village of Kocho in northern Iraq was home to about 1,700 Yazidis—a small religious minority whose ancient faith combines elements of Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam. To their ISIS attackers, they were *kafirs* (infidels), devil-worshippers who deserved only death or slavery.

On August 3, 2014, ISIS surrounded the village. For 13 days, the Yazidis were held hostage. ISIS commanders arrived daily with an ultimatum: **Convert to Islam or die.**

The village elders refused. They knew that conversion was a lie—ISIS had already decided their fate.

On August 15, the siege ended. ISIS fighters separated the villagers by age and gender with chilling efficiency:

*   **Men and Boys Over 12**: Taken to the edge of the village in trucks. They were lined up and machine-gunned into mass graves. Approximately **312 men and boys** were executed in Kocho alone that day.
*   **Elderly Women**: Deemed too old to be useful as slaves, they were shot on the spot.
*   **Young Women and Children**: Loaded onto trucks like livestock.

**Nadia Murad** was 21 years old when she was forced into one of those trucks. She watched as her mother and six of her nine brothers were taken to the killing fields. She never saw them again.

### The Enslavement System: *Saby* as State Policy

What followed was not random violence—it was a bureaucratic system of sexual slavery that ISIS called *Saby*, citing medieval Islamic jurisprudence.

Nadia and approximately **6,800 other Yazidi women and girls** were driven to Mosul, where they were held in a converted school. ISIS fighters inspected them like property, checking their teeth, examining their bodies. The women were then distributed through an organized system:

*   **Slave Markets**: Women were sold in public auctions, with prices set according to age. Prepubescent girls fetched the highest prices.
*   **Notarized Contracts**: ISIS issued official slave contracts (*milk al-yamin*, "those whom the right hand possesses"), complete with stamps and signatures. The contracts specified ownership and could be transferred.
*   **"Gifting" to Fighters**: High-value captives were often given as rewards to ISIS commanders or foreign fighters as an incentive for recruitment.

### Nadia's Ordeal

Nadia was sold and resold among ISIS fighters like property. She was repeatedly raped, beaten, and tortured. She was forced to convert to Islam at gunpoint. She tried to escape twice and was caught both times, each recapture bringing new brutality.

> *"I was not allowed to eat, sleep, or even breathe freely,"* she later recounted. *"I was their slave."*

Finally, with the help of a Muslim family in Mosul who risked their lives to hide her, Nadia escaped. She made it to a refugee camp in Duhok, then to Germany. She could have disappeared into quiet anonymity, rebuilding her shattered life in silence.

Instead, she chose to speak.

In 2015, Nadia addressed the United Nations, describing in unflinching detail what ISIS had done to her and to thousands of other Yazidi women and girls. She became the face of a genocide the world had tried to ignore. In 2018, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Dr. Denis Mukwege for their efforts to end sexual violence as a weapon of war.

But the Yazidi genocide is not an aberration in extremist ideology—it is the logical conclusion of a theological worldview that divides humanity into the "saved" and the "other," where the "other" has no rights, no humanity, and no future.

This ideology is not unique to Islam. Every major religion has, at times, weaponized the concept of the "other" to justify unspeakable violence. This chapter traces how the treatment of non-believers—from the Ghiyar laws of medieval Baghdad to the Yazidi genocide—reveals the darkest implications of exclusionary theology.

The extremist worldview is fundamentally binary: the *House of Islam* vs. the *House of War*. In this Manichaean vision, the "Other"—the Jew, the Christian, the Yazidi—is dehumanized to serve a narrative of domination. But this modern brutality has roots in the darker chapters of history, where administrative discrimination evolved into systematic suppression.

## The Invention of the Yellow Star: The *Ghiyar* Laws

Long before the Nuremberg Laws of Nazi Germany, the Abbasid Caliphate institutionalized the visual segregation of minorities. In 850 CE, the Caliph **Al-Mutawakkil** issued a decree that would echo through the centuries, transforming the cosmopolitan Baghdad of his predecessors into a city of visible apartheid.

### The Badge of Shame
Al-Mutawakkil was not content with mere legal inferiority for non-Muslims; he demanded visual humiliation. He ordered that all *Dhimmis* (protected non-Muslims) must wear honey-colored (*asfar*) outer garments and hoods.

*   **The Patches**: They were required to attach two honey-colored patches to their clothes, one on the chest and one on the back. This is the direct historical ancestor of the yellow star forced upon Jews in medieval Europe and later by the Nazis. The color yellow was chosen specifically for its association with bile and sickness in medieval humoral medicine—it was the color of shame.

*   **The "Devils"**: In a twist of psychological cruelty, he ordered that wooden figures of devils be nailed to the doors of their homes. This was not just identification; it was demonization. It told every Muslim passerby: *Here lives an enemy of God.*

*   **The Zunnar**: Christians and Jews were forced to wear a distinctive belt (*Zunnar*) to prevent them from passing as Muslims in public spaces. They were forbidden from riding horses (a symbol of nobility) and could only ride mules or donkeys, and even then, only with wooden stirrups.^[Stillman, Norman A. *The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book*. Jewish Publication Society, 1979. Stillman provides primary source translations of Al-Mutawakkil's decree.]

These laws, known as **Ghiyar** (differentiation), were not always enforced, but they established a legal precedent for humiliation that extremists today seek to revive. When ISIS marked Christian homes in Mosul with the letter 'N' (for *Nasara*, Nazarene), they were not inventing a new tactic; they were citing Al-Mutawakkil.

## The Suppression of Rivals: Zoroastrians and Manichaeans

While "People of the Book" (Jews and Christians) were granted a second-class status, other faiths faced existential erasure.

*   **The Extinguishing of the Fire**: Zoroastrianism, once the state religion of Persia, was systematically dismantled. Fire temples were destroyed or converted into mosques. The sacred **Cypress of Kashmar**, a 1,400-year-old tree believed to have been planted by Zoroaster himself, was felled by order of Caliph Al-Mutawakkil to be used in his new palace—a symbolic act of cultural decapitation that devastated the Zoroastrian community.

*   **The Inquisition of the "Zindiqs"**: Manichaeism, a dualistic gnostic faith, was ruthlessly hunted. The Abbasid Caliph Al-Mahdi (775–785 CE) established a dedicated inquisition to root out *Zindiqs* (heretics/Manichaeans). Thousands were executed, their books burned, and the religion was effectively wiped out from the Middle East.^[Choksy, Jamsheed K. *Conflict and Cooperation: Zoroastrian Subalterns and Muslim Elites in Medieval Iranian Society*. Columbia University Press, 1997. A detailed study of the decline of Zoroastrianism under Islamic rule.]

## The Modern Application: *Al-Wala' wa-l-Bara'*

Today, groups like ISIS have weaponized the doctrine of **Al-Wala' wa-l-Bara'** (Loyalty and Disavowal).

*   **Social Apartheid**: It forbids friendship with non-Muslims, participation in their festivals, or even wishing them peace. It creates a psychological ghetto that prevents integration.

*   **The Yazidi Genocide**: In 2014, ISIS revived the ancient institution of *Saby* (slavery) against the Yazidis in Sinjar. Citing medieval jurisprudence that classified Yazidis as "devil worshippers" (a distortion of their theology), they justified the mass execution of men and the sexual enslavement of thousands of women and girls. This was not a random act of cruelty; it was a bureaucratic application of a twisted theology, complete with notarized slave contracts.

The road from Al-Mutawakkil's yellow badge to the slave markets of Raqqa is long, but the logic is consistent: the "Other" is not a fellow human, but a subject to be marked, managed, or extinguished.

## The Bangladesh Machete Attacks: The War on Atheist Bloggers

In the modern world, a new category of "Other" has emerged: the **atheist**. For extremists, the secular voice is even more dangerous than the infidel because it comes from within—it is apostasy (*riddah*).

### The Digital Inquisition (2013-2016)

Between 2013 and 2016, Bangladesh witnessed a horrifying pattern: secular bloggers and activists were hunted down and killed with machetes in broad daylight.

*   **February 15, 2013**: **Ahmed Rajib Haider**, a 30-year-old architect and blogger, was hacked to death outside his home by members of a group calling itself "Ansarullah Bangla Team."
*   **February 26, 2015**: **Avijit Roy**, a Bangladeshi-American blogger who wrote about science and secularism, was attacked with machetes in Dhaka while returning from a book fair. He died at the scene. His wife, Rafida Bonya Ahmed, survived with severe injuries.
*   **May 12, 2015**: **Ananta Bijoy Das**, a banker and blogger who criticized religious extremism, was hacked to death by four men with machetes.
*   **August 7, 2015**: **Niloy Chakrabarti**, a blogger who wrote under the pseudonym "Niloy Neel," was killed in his home.

**The Method**: The attacks were almost ritualistic—machetes, not guns. The symbolism was clear: these men were being slaughtered like animals.

**The Response**: Instead of protecting the bloggers, the Bangladeshi government arrested several of them for "hurting religious sentiments." The message was clear: criticize Islam, and you are on your own.

## The Apostasy Dilemma: Why Leaving Islam Is Considered Treason

To understand the violence against atheists, one must understand the classical Islamic law of **apostasy (*riddah*)**.

### The Hadith Basis
The most cited justification for killing apostates comes from a hadith in Sahih Bukhari:
> *"Whoever changes his religion, kill him."* (Sahih Bukhari 6922)

This single sentence has been used to justify the execution of thousands of people over 1,400 years.

### The Legal Framework
In classical Islamic jurisprudence (across all four Sunni schools):

*   **The Crime**: Apostasy is defined as a Muslim publicly renouncing Islam or blaspheming the Prophet.
*   **The Punishment**: Death penalty (for men). Imprisonment until repentance (for women in some schools).
*   **The Grace Period**: The apostate is given three days to repent. If they recant, they are spared. If not, they are executed.

### The Modern Application
While most Muslim-majority countries do not enforce the death penalty for apostasy in state law, 13 countries still have it on the books:

*   **Saudi Arabia, Iran, Sudan, Yemen, Somalia, Mauritania**: Official death penalty.
*   **Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh**: Blasphemy laws are used as a proxy to achieve the same result.

### The Reformist Argument
Progressive scholars argue that the hadith has been misinterpreted. They point out:

1.  **Historical Context**: Apostasy in the 7th century was not just "changing religion"—it was *desertion during war*, akin to treason.
2.  **Quranic Freedom**: The Quran repeatedly affirms "There is no compulsion in religion" (Quran 2:256) and leaves the punishment of apostasy to the afterlife, not to humans.
3.  **The Prophetic Practice**: The Prophet himself pardoned many who left Islam (e.g., Abdullah ibn Sa'd, who was forgiven after Mecca's conquest).

But conservative scholars reject this reformist reading, and the machetes keep falling.

## Key Takeaways

**[THE BIG IDEA]**:: Dehumanization isn't a theological accident—it's a deliberate psychological tool to justify violence by reducing victims to sub-human "pollution."

**[WHAT WE LEARNED]**::
- **Yazidi genocide**: ISIS's sex slavery was justified through selective theology (*kāfir* = permissible to enslave)
- **Blasphemy laws**: Pakistan's legal system punishes "thought crime," making religion itself a death sentence
- The rhetoric of "pollution" (*najis*) turns victims into objects that must be "cleansed"
- Dehumanization follows a pattern: ideological label -> moral exclusion -> violence permission

**[DYNAMIC CONNECTION]**:: This chapter shows **Dynamic 4: The Mechanism of Belonging**—creating a psychological wall between the "Pure" in-group and the "Filthy" out-group.

**[COUNTERINTUITIVE INSIGHT]**:: ISIS's enslavement of Yazidis wasn't "medieval barbarism"—it was calculated strategy. Trafficking women and children became a recruitment tool and revenue stream, proving that extremist theology serves material goals.
