# The Global Jihad: From Kabul to Raqqa

If 1924 was the year of collapse, 1979 was the year of ignition. Three events in that single year set the stage for the modern era of global terrorism: the Iranian Revolution, the Siege of Mecca, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It is the latter that birthed the "Global Jihad."

## The Afghan Jihad: The Incubator

When Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan in December 1979, it was framed not as a Cold War proxy battle, but as a defense of Muslim lands against godless atheists. The ideological spark came from **Abdullah Azzam**, a Palestinian scholar who issued a fatwa declaring that Jihad in Afghanistan was *Fard Ayn* (an individual duty) for every able-bodied Muslim. This call to arms drew thousands of young men to Peshawar, Pakistan, forming the "Afghan Arabs." Among them was a wealthy Saudi heir named **Osama bin Laden**. This mobilization was fueled by a massive influx of cash and weaponry from the US and Saudi Arabia, who poured billions into the *Mujahideen*, inadvertently radicalizing an entire generation in their zeal to bleed the Soviets.

## Al-Qaeda: The Base

As the war ended, Bin Laden and Azzam founded **Al-Qaeda** ("The Base") in 1988. Their vision diverged: Azzam wanted to liberate Muslim lands, while Bin Laden, influenced by the Egyptian surgeon **Ayman al-Zawahiri**, turned his sights on the "Far Enemy"—the United States.

The September 11 attacks were the culmination of this shift. They weren't just about killing Americans—they were a calculated provocation designed to lure the United States into invading Muslim lands. Bin Laden believed this would expose the "crusader" agenda, bankrupt the US economy, and create failed states where jihadism could flourish. **It worked.** The invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq destabilized the region and created the vacuum for ISIS.

## The Zarqawi Moment: The Birth of ISIS

While Al-Qaeda focused on the West, a Jordanian thug-turned-theologian named **Abu Musab al-Zarqawi** had a different vision. Arriving in Iraq after the 2003 US invasion, he founded *Al-Qaeda in Iraq* (AQI), the precursor to ISIS.

Zarqawi differed from Bin Laden in two critical ways. First, he was deeply **sectarian**, hating Shias even more than Americans and bombing their shrines to spark a civil war. Second, while Bin Laden hid in caves, Zarqawi wanted to **rule cities**. He implemented a strategy known as *Idarat al-Tawahhush* ("The Management of Savagery"), aiming to create chaos so extreme that the population would submit to his rule just to restore order.

## The Civil War: Al-Qaeda vs. ISIS

The split between Al-Qaeda and ISIS was not just political; it was theological and personal. It was a mob war for the soul of Jihad. When the Syrian Civil War began, Al-Qaeda's affiliate **Jabhat al-Nusra** was fighting the Assad regime. In April 2013, ISIS leader Baghdadi announced a hostile takeover, merging his group with Nusra. Nusra's leader refused and appealed to Al-Qaeda's chief, Zawahiri, who ruled in his favor. Baghdadi famously replied: *"I have chosen the command of God over the command of Zawahiri,"* shattering the global jihadist movement.

This schism revealed a fundamental strategic divide. **Al-Qaeda** viewed itself as a "Vanguard," believing in a "hearts and minds" approach—don't alienate the locals, don't kill Shias indiscriminately, and build support slowly. **ISIS**, by contrast, operated as a "State," believing in "compliance through terror." Their strategy was total war: kill everyone who resists, behead Shias, and declare the Caliphate *now*.

ISIS eclipsed Al-Qaeda. Young recruits didn't want to sit in a cave listening to a 70-year-old doctor (Zawahiri) lecture on theology; they wanted to join the winning team that was capturing cities and making Hollywood-style movies. Al-Qaeda became the "Betamax" of terror; ISIS was the streaming service.

## The Islamic State: A Proto-State Emerges

On June 29, 2014, ISIS declared the establishment of a **Caliphate**. Baghdadi proclaimed himself "Caliph Ibrahim," claiming supreme religious and political authority over all Muslims worldwide. Unlike Al-Qaeda's loose network, ISIS built a functioning bureaucracy with ministries for Finance, Media, and Sharia, and divided territory into provinces (*Wilayat*). They revolutionized jihadi media with *Dabiq* and *Rumiyah* magazines, which framed the group not as terrorists, but as state-builders.

## Comparative Case Studies: The Hydra of Extremism

ISIS is not alone. The ideology forged in the mountains of Tora Bora has metastasized into a global franchise. **Boko Haram** in Nigeria pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2015, adopting its tactics of mass kidnapping and suicide bombings. **Al Shabaab** in Somalia remains affiliated with Al-Qaeda, aiming to establish a caliphate in the Horn of Africa through truck bombings and complex attacks like the Westgate Mall siege. Meanwhile, the **Taliban** in Afghanistan represents a different strain—Deobandi fundamentalism fused with Pashtun nationalism—which successfully returned to power in 2021.

The blueprint for terror established in the Afghan cave-turned-conference-room in 1988 is still in use today. Al-Qaeda metastasized into a global franchise, while ISIS attempted to build the territorial Caliphate. The ideology has spread from the deserts of Mali to the jungles of the Philippines and the streets of Paris.

## Key Takeaways

**[THE BIG IDEA]**:: Modern global jihadism was born when three forces converged in 1979 Afghanistan: Saudi money, CIA weapons, and desperate fighters from across the Muslim world.

**[WHAT WE LEARNED]**::
- The Afghan Jihad (1979-1989) created the "Foreign Fighter" phenomenon that persists today
- **Al-Qaeda** ("The Base") was founded in 1988 as a database of veteran jihadists—it later became the world's first franchised terror network
- **Abu Musab al-Zarqawi** pioneered sectarian warfare in Iraq (2003-2006), targeting Shia civilians to provoke civil war
- The **Al-Qaeda → ISIS split** (2014) was a theological civil war over strategy: ISIS wanted the Caliphate *now*, Al-Qaeda wanted patience

**[CYCLE CONNECTION]**:: This chapter shows **Phase 5 - Radicalization** in action. The ideology (Qutb, Wahhabism) hardens into violence. *Takfir* becomes a weapon. The movement goes global.

**[COUNTERINTUITIVE INSIGHT]**:: The U.S. and Saudi Arabia funded the mujahideen against the Soviets. We called them "freedom fighters." Within a decade, they attacked New York. Blowback is not a theory—it's a historical pattern.

## THE PATTERN REPEATS

The IRA followed the same radicalization arc:

- **Phase 2 - The Shock**: Bloody Sunday (1972)—British soldiers killed 14 unarmed protesters
- **Phase 3 - The Crisis**: "Who will defend us?"
- **Phase 4 - The Ideology**: Provisional IRA forms, rejects peaceful politics
- **Phase 5 - The Radicalization**: Bombings in mainland Britain (1970s-90s)
- **Phase 6 - The Collapse**: Good Friday Agreement (1998)

Like Al-Qaeda, the IRA started as a nationalist resistance and degenerated into terror. Same cycle, different flag.

## The Lessons of Raqqa

ISIS's physical caliphate collapsed in 2019, but its ideological state persists online. The journey from the mountains of Tora Bora to the government offices of Raqqa was complete—the Global Jihad had evolved from a terrorist group into a proto-state. And when the state fell, it simply migrated to the cloud.
