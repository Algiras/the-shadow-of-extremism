# Chapter 14: The Saffron Robe: Buddhism and the 969 Movement

When we think of Buddhism, we typically imagine meditation, mindfulness, and the Dalai Lama preaching compassion. We imagine a philosophy so inherently peaceful that it seems immune to the virus of extremism. We assume that while monotheistic religions—with their jealous Gods and holy wars—might be prone to violence, the path of the Buddha is a firewall against hate.

This assumption is dangerous. It blinds us to one of the most potent and violent forms of ethno-religious nationalism in the modern world.

In Myanmar and Sri Lanka, the Saffron Robe has become a uniform of war. Monks do not just bless the troops; they organize militias, incite pogroms, and provide the theological justification for ethnic cleansing. The rise of militant Buddhism shatters the Western myth of "peaceful Buddhism" and proves a darker universal truth: **any identity, when threatened, can be weaponized.**

## The Paradox of the Warrior Monk

To understand how a religion based on *Ahimsa* (non-violence) can justify genocide, we must look beyond the Westernized, sanitized version of Buddhism often sold in yoga studios. We must look at the historical and theological roots of the "Warrior Monk."

### The Theology of Defense

While the Buddha famously taught that "hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love," Buddhist scripture also contains the seeds of a "Just War" tradition, primarily centered on the defense of the Dhamma (the teachings).

1.  **The King and the Monk**: In Theravada Buddhism (dominant in Sri Lanka and Myanmar), there is a symbiotic relationship between the State (*Chakravartin*, or Wheel-Turning Monarch) and the Faith (*Sasana*). The King protects the Faith, and the Faith legitimizes the King. If the Faith is threatened, the King is obligated to wage war to defend it.
2.  **The *Mahavamsa* Chronicle**: This 5th-century Sri Lankan text is the "Old Testament" of Buddhist nationalism. It tells the story of King Dutthagamani, who waged war against Tamil invaders. After the slaughter, he felt remorse. But enlightened monks (Arahants) comforted him, saying:
    > *"Do not worry, O King. You have caused the death of only one and a half human beings. The rest were unbelievers and men of evil life, not more to be esteemed than beasts."*
    
    This passage is the "nuclear option" of Buddhist extremism. It explicitly dehumanizes non-Buddhists, stripping them of moral worth to justify their killing in defense of the Sasana.

### Imperial Zen: The Ghost of WWII

This phenomenon is not new. Before the 969 Movement, there was **Imperial Zen**. During World War II, the Japanese Zen establishment almost unanimously supported the war effort, framing Japanese militarism as a holy war to purify Asia.

**Brian Victoria**, in his seminal work *Zen at War*, documented how Zen masters twisted Buddhist doctrine to justify slaughter:
*   **"Killing One to Save Many"**: Masters argued that killing "deluded" enemies was an act of compassion, liberating them from their bad karma.
*   **"The Sword that Gives Life"**: The Zen concept of the "sword of wisdom" (cutting through delusion) was literalized into the katana of the Imperial soldier.
*   **No-Self in Battle**: Soldiers were taught to enter a state of *mushin* (no-mind) so they could kill without hesitation or guilt.

This historical precedent proves that Buddhism, like any other faith, can be co-opted by the state to serve the machinery of death.

## Myanmar: The 969 Movement and the Rohingya Genocide

In Myanmar, this theological defense mechanism evolved into a modern, branded movement of hate: **969**.

### The "Bin Laden of Buddhism"

**Ashin Wirathu** does not look like a warlord. He is a soft-spoken monk in saffron robes, often seen smiling in photographs. But in 2013, *Time* magazine put his face on its cover with the headline: *"The Face of Buddhist Terror."*

Wirathu is the spiritual leader of the **969 Movement**, a nationalist organization that views Islam as an existential threat to Myanmar's Buddhist identity. His rhetoric mirrors that of European fascists or Islamist demagogues, but it is wrapped in the language of the Dhamma.

### The Rhetoric of Dehumanization

Wirathu's most infamous metaphor is that of the "mad dog." In a sermon that went viral across Myanmar, he explained why violence against Muslims was necessary:

> *"You can be full of kindness and love, but you cannot sleep next to a mad dog."*

This single sentence performs a complex psychological maneuver:
1.  **It acknowledges Buddhist values** ("kindness and love").
2.  **It creates an exception** (the "mad dog").
3.  **It dehumanizes the enemy**: Muslims are not humans with rights; they are dangerous animals.
4.  **It justifies preemptive violence**: You do not negotiate with a mad dog; you put it down for the safety of the community.

### The Numerology of Hate: 969 vs. 786

Symbols matter. In the streets of Yangon and Mandalay, the number **969** became a badge of loyalty, plastered on taxis, shop windows, and homes. It was designed as a direct cosmological counter to the Muslim symbol **786**.

*   **786**: In South Asian Islam, the number 786 is a numerological representation of the *Basmala* ("In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"). Muslims use it to mark halal businesses or homes.
*   **The Conspiracy**: Wirathu and his followers spread a conspiracy theory that 7+8+6 = 21, meaning Muslims plotted to conquer Myanmar in the 21st century.
*   **969**: To counter this, they chose 969, representing the **9** attributes of the Buddha, the **6** attributes of the Dhamma (teachings), and the **9** attributes of the Sangha (community).

This was not just a sticker campaign. It was a boycott. The 969 movement urged Buddhists to buy only from 969-marked shops and to socially ostracize Muslims. It created a "state within a state," segregating the economy along religious lines.

### Economic Warfare: The "No Halal" Campaign

Beyond symbolism, the 969 Movement weaponized the economy. In 2013, Wirathu launched the **"National Campaign to Buy Burmese"**, which was code for "Don't Buy from Muslims." The methods were systematic:

*   **Shop Identification**: 969 stickers became mandatory for "approved" Buddhist businesses. Any shop without the sticker was assumed to be Muslim.
*   **Intimidation**: Monks would patrol markets, taking photos of Buddhists who shopped at Muslim stores and posting them on Facebook with shaming captions.
*   **"Halal Paranoia"**: Wirathu spread rumors that halal certification secretly funneled money to "Islamic terrorists in the Middle East" and that halal food contained chemicals to make Buddhists infertile.

The result: Muslim businesses collapsed. Entire neighborhoods were economically strangled without a single act of physical violence. This is extremism through social pressure—no bombs needed, just ostracism.

### The Road to Genocide: A Timeline of Escalation

The genocide of 2017 did not happen in a vacuum. It was the culmination of a five-year campaign of escalation, driven by the 969 Movement and its political successor, **Ma Ba Tha** (Association for the Protection of Race and Religion).

#### 2012: The Spark
Violence erupts in Rakhine State after the alleged rape of a Buddhist woman by Muslim men.
*   **The Narrative**: Wirathu seizes on the incident to paint all Muslims as rapists and predators.
*   **The Violence**: Mobs burn Rohingya villages. 140,000 Rohingya are displaced into squalid IDP camps.
*   **The Monk's Role**: Monks block humanitarian aid to the camps, claiming it supports "terrorists."

#### 2015: The Race and Religion Laws
Ma Ba Tha, now a powerful political lobby, pressures the government to pass four "Protection of Race and Religion Laws."
1.  **Religious Conversion Bill**: Requires government approval to convert religion (aimed at preventing Buddhists from converting to Islam).
2.  **Buddhist Women's Special Marriage Bill**: Restricts Buddhist women from marrying non-Buddhist men.
3.  **Population Control Healthcare Bill**: Allows the government to enforce birth spacing (aimed at the "high birth rate" of Muslims).
4.  **Monogamy Bill**: Criminalizes polygamy.

These laws were a triumph for the extremist monks. They codified discrimination into the legal DNA of the state.

#### 2016: The Flashpoint
A small Rohingya insurgent group (ARSA) attacks police outposts.
*   **The Reaction**: The military launches "clearance operations."
*   **The Propaganda**: Ma Ba Tha spreads images of "Buddhist victims" (often faked or taken from other conflicts) to whip up nationalist fervor.

#### 2017: The Final Solution
In August, ARSA launches a larger attack. The military response is total war.
*   **The Death Toll**: Doctors Without Borders (MSF) estimated that at least **6,700 Rohingya** were killed in the first month of violence alone. Other estimates place the total death toll as high as **25,000**.
*   **Displacement**: Over **740,000** Rohingya were forced to flee to Bangladesh, creating the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazar.
*   **Sexual Violence**: The UN reported systematic rape and sexual violence used as a weapon of war—tactics identical to those used by ISIS against the Yazidis.

Monks were not just bystanders. Many participated in the mobs that burned Rohingya villages. They blocked aid convoys. They preached that killing "Bengalis" (the derogatory term for Rohingya) was a defense of the nation.

## Sri Lanka: The 25-Year Civil War and the BBS

Myanmar is not an anomaly. In Sri Lanka, Buddhist nationalism fueled a **25-year civil war** (1983-2009) and continues to incite violence today.

### The Myth of the "Chosen People"

Sri Lankan Buddhism is built on the **Mahavamsa** myth: the belief that the Buddha himself visited the island and designated it as the sanctuary for his teachings. This makes the Sinhalese people not just an ethnic group, but a "Chosen People" with a divine mandate to protect the island from "invaders."

The "invaders" in this narrative are the Tamils (predominantly Hindu) and the Muslims.

### The Civil War (1983-2009)

The war between the Sinhalese-dominated government and the **Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)** was brutal. But it was the Buddhist clergy who ensured there could be no compromise.

*   **The JHU (Jathika Hela Urumaya)**: In 2004, a political party composed entirely of Buddhist monks entered parliament. Their platform was explicit: no federalism, no autonomy for Tamils, and a military solution to the conflict.
*   **Blocking Peace**: Every time a Sri Lankan government attempted to negotiate a peace deal with the Tamils, the monks mobilized massive street protests to block it, labeling any compromise as a "betrayal of the Sasana."

The war ended in 2009 with a military victory that killed up to **40,000 Tamil civilians** in the final months. The monks celebrated this slaughter as a holy victory, ringing temple bells across the island.

### Bodu Bala Sena: The New Enemy

With the Tamils defeated, the nationalist machine needed a new enemy. It found one in the Muslims.

**Bodu Bala Sena** (BBS, Buddhist Power Force), led by **Gnanasara Thero**, emerged in 2012. Gnanasara is a firebrand monk who models himself on Wirathu (the two signed a formal alliance in 2014).

#### The 2014 Aluthgama Riots

In June 2014, BBS organized a rally in the coastal town of Aluthgama. Gnanasara Thero delivered an incendiary speech:

> *"This is a Sinhala Buddhist country! The police and the army are Sinhalese! If a single Muslim lays a hand on a Sinhalese, that will be the end of all of them!"*

Hours later, mobs attacked Muslim neighborhoods. **Four people** were killed, over **80 injured**, and hundreds of homes and businesses were destroyed. Police stood by and watched.

#### The Easter Bombings and the Backlash (2019)

In 2019, an ISIS-inspired group bombed churches and hotels in Sri Lanka, killing 269 people. This horrific act was a gift to the BBS. It validated their narrative that Muslims were an existential threat.

In the aftermath, the BBS and other nationalist groups launched a campaign of collective punishment:
*   **Boycotts**: "Don't buy from Muslims."
*   **False Accusations**: A Muslim doctor, Dr. Shafi, was accused of secretly sterilizing 4,000 Buddhist women. The story was a complete fabrication, but it led to his arrest and a national hysteria fueled by the monks.

## Thailand: The Saffron Soldiers

Even in relatively peaceful Thailand, Buddhist nationalism is rising.

*   **The Southern Insurgency**: In Thailand's Muslim-majority southern provinces, a separatist insurgency has killed **7,000+ people** since 2004. Buddhist monks have been targeted, and in response, some monasteries have been militarized.
*   **Monk Vigilantes**: In 2017, photos emerged of Thai monks carrying rifles while patrolling villages. The government defended this as "self-defense against Islamic terrorism."

## The Universal Lesson

The 969 Movement, Bodu Bala Sena, and Thai militant monks teach us a terrifying lesson: **Peaceful theology is no barrier to violent politics.**

Buddhism, with its core tenet of *ahimsa* (non-violence), should be the hardest religion to weaponize. But when identity is fused with state power and fueled by existential anxiety, even the Saffron Robe can become a uniform of war.

The pattern is universal:
1.  **Sacred Text**: The *Mahavamsa* is weaponized like the Quran or the Bible.
2.  **Mythic Past**: A golden age when the land belonged solely to "us."
3.  **Existential Threat**: The minority is framed as a demographic or cultural danger ("The Mad Dog").
4.  **Economic Strangulation**: Boycotts and segregation before outright violence.
5.  **State Complicity**: Police and military either participate or stand aside.

No religion is immune to the shadow.
