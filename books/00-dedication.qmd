# Dedication {.unnumbered}

To **Justina Krasauskienė**, whose inspiration and desire to help the world understand this critical topic made this book possible.

---

And to all those who:

- Seek understanding over fear
- Choose dialogue over division
- Believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone, regardless of economic circumstance
- Work quietly and courageously to prevent the cycle of extremism from claiming another generation

May this work contribute, in some small way, to a world where understanding replaces ignorance, compassion defeats hatred, and the shadow is finally eclipsed by light.
