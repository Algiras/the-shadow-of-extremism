# Support This Work {#support .unnumbered}

This book is published **free of charge** because knowledge about extremism, history, and pathways to peace should be accessible to everyone—regardless of economic circumstances.

## Why Free?

- **Education as a Public Good**: Understanding the roots of extremism is critical for building a more peaceful world
- **Global Accessibility**: Readers in conflict zones often can't afford books
- **Open Research**: Free sharing accelerates understanding and discussion

## Current Funding Goal: Audiobook Production

I'm raising **€5,000** to produce a professional audiobook version of this book using ElevenLabs AI narration. This will make the content accessible to:
- Commuters and busy professionals
- Visually impaired readers
- People with learning disabilities (dyslexia, ADHD)
- Listeners in regions with limited literacy

**Progress**: €0 / €5,000 (0%)

Once funded, the audiobook will be released **free** under the same Creative Commons license.
