This book would not exist without the intellectual generosity, patience, and critical engagement of many individuals who challenged, corrected, and encouraged me throughout this journey.

## Academic Mentors and Reviewers

I am deeply indebted to the scholars who reviewed early drafts and prevented countless errors. Professor [Name], whose expertise in Islamic jurisprudence kept me honest when discussing *fiqh* and *usul al-fiqh*. Dr. [Name], whose work on colonial history shaped my understanding of the Sykes-Picot legacy. [Name], a former analyst at [Institution], who provided invaluable insight into the operational mechanics of terrorist organizations.

Special thanks to the anonymous peer reviewers who challenged my framing, pointed out blind spots, and forced me to sharpen my arguments. Your critical eye made this a far better book.

## Research Assistance

My gratitude to the archivists and librarians at [Institution/Library] who helped me navigate Arabic-language primary sources and historical documents. To [Translator Name], who assisted with translations from classical Arabic and ensured I did not misrepresent textual nuances. To the researchers at the [Counter-Terrorism Archive/Dataset], whose meticulous documentation of extremist propaganda made Chapter 9 possible.

## Voices of Experience

This book was profoundly shaped by conversations with individuals who lived the realities I could only study. To [Name], a former member of [Organization] who shared their story of radicalization and de-radicalization with courage and honesty. To [Name], a survivor of [Conflict], whose testimony reminded me that behind every statistic is a human being. I cannot name many of you for reasons of safety, but your voices are woven throughout this text.

## Family and Friends

To my family, who endured five years of dinner conversations about jihad, colonialism, and theological hairsplitting with patience and love. To [Partner/Spouse Name], who read every draft, challenged every lazy argument, and reminded me to write for humans, not academics. To [Friend Name], who kept me grounded when I disappeared into research rabbit holes for months at a time.

To my parents, who taught me that curiosity is a virtue and that the hardest questions are the ones most worth asking.

## Community Feedback
