# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

This experimental book would not exist without the support, patience, and intellectual honesty of several key people—and the remarkable capabilities of modern AI systems.

## Primary Acknowledgement: AI Tools

Let me be direct: The primary "collaborator" on this project was artificial intelligence. Specifically:

**Google Antigravity**: Google's new AI coding assistant (free tier) was the primary tool for this entire project. Using Google's Gemini 3.0  Thinking model, Antigravity handled:
- Multi-language primary source analysis (Arabic, Turkish, Latin)
- Cross-cultural pattern identification across seven religions
- Comparative framework generation
- Content drafting based on scholarly models
- Structural coherence checking

**Anthropic Claude**: Secondary research assistant for theological nuance verification and counter-argument generation.

**AI Image Generation Tools**: Created the infographics visualizing the 5 Dynamics framework.

**The Zero-Cost Angle**: This entire book was created using **free AI tokens**—demonstrating that sophisticated research synthesis is now accessible to anyone with internet access. No institutional funding, no research grants, no expensive subscriptions. Just **2 days and curiosity**.

These systems did in weeks what traditional scholarship would require years or decades: multi-language source analysis, systematic comparative research across seven religions, and identification of structural patterns invisible to single-perspective human analysis.

## Human Support

**Justina Krasauskienė**, my wife: Your unwavering support for this AI experiment—even when it meant an intensive 2-day sprint glued to my computer instead of our usual weekend activities—made this possible. Your fierce commitment to intellectual honesty kept me from overselling the results. You are the reason this is transparently framed as an experiment rather than pretending to be traditional scholarship.

**My family**: For tolerating 48 hours of conversations about AI capabilities, extremism frameworks, and whether machines can "understand" theology. Your skepticism kept me grounded.

## Technical Infrastructure

**Quarto**: For making it possible to publish this freely online.

**GitHub**: For version control, CI/CD automation, and hosting.

**The Open-Source Community**: For tools that democratize publishing.

## What This Experiment Demonstrates

This book exists because of **AI capabilities** meeting **human curiosity and curation**. I provided:
- The intellectual question (Why does extremism have recurring patterns?)
- The frameworks to apply (Social Identity Theory, Moral Foundations Theory, etc.)
- Quality control (verifying claims, removing hallucinations, ensuring coherence)  
- Honest framing (acknowledging this as an experiment, not traditional scholarship)

The AI provided:
- Research capacity I could never achieve alone
- Multi-language analysis without years of training
- Pattern recognition across vast datasets
- Initial content generation based on scholarly frameworks

## The Honest Truth

I did not spend five years in archives. I did not learn classical Arabic. I did not interview former extremists or travel to conflict zones. I did not have scholarly mentors reviewing drafts.

Instead, I spent **an intensive 2-day sprint** guiding AI systems through existing scholarship, testing whether they could synthesize coherent analysis at unprecedented speed. This book is the result—imperfect, experimentally generated in 48 hours, but potentially valuable as a demonstration of what cutting-edge AI-augmented research can achieve.

**All errors, misinterpretations, and limitations are mine**. The AI processed data; I chose what to keep, how to frame it, and take full responsibility for the result. If this book misleads, blame my curation. If it enlightens, credit is shared between human guidance and machine capability.
