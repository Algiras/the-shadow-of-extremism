# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

This book would not exist without the intellectual generosity, patience, and critical engagement of many individuals who challenged, corrected, and encouraged me throughout this journey.

## Academic Mentors and Reviewers

I am deeply indebted to the scholars who reviewed early drafts and prevented countless errors—experts in Islamic jurisprudence who kept me honest when discussing *fiqh* and *usul al-fiqh*, historians of colonialism who shaped my understanding of the Sykes-Picot legacy, and former intelligence analysts who provided invaluable insight into the operational mechanics of terrorist organizations.

Special thanks to the anonymous peer reviewers who challenged my framing, pointed out blind spots, and forced me to sharpen my arguments. Your critical eye made this a far better book.

## Research Assistance

My gratitude to the archivists and librarians who helped me navigate Arabic-language primary sources and historical documents. To those who assisted with translations from classical Arabic and ensured I did not misrepresent textual nuances. To the researchers whose meticulous documentation of extremist propaganda made the analysis in Chapter 9 possible.

## Voices of Experience

This book was profoundly shaped by conversations with individuals who lived the realities I could only study—former members of extremist organizations who shared their stories of radicalization and de-radicalization with courage and honesty, and survivors of conflict whose testimonies reminded me that behind every statistic is a human being. I cannot name many of you for reasons of safety, but your voices are woven throughout this text.

## Family and Friends

To my family, who endured five years of dinner conversations about jihad, colonialism, and theological hairsplitting with patience and love. To my wife, a fierce defender of free speech, who read every draft with uncompromising honesty and challenged every lazy argument—reminding me that if I couldn't explain it clearly, I didn't understand it well enough. Your commitment to intellectual integrity, even when it made the work harder, made this book stronger.

To my mother, a historian whose rigorous approach to primary sources and distrust of grand narratives shaped my methodology more than any graduate seminar. You taught me that history is not about heroes and villains, but about understanding why people made the choices they did with the information they had. That lesson is woven through every chapter.

To my parents, who taught me that curiosity is a virtue and that the hardest questions are the ones most worth asking.


## Technical Support

To the open-source community behind Quarto, which made it possible to publish this book freely online. To the developers of GitHub Actions whose automation allowed me to focus on content rather than deployment infrastructure.

To everyone who asked, "How's the book coming?" even when I had nothing to report—your interest sustained me.
