# Hassan al-Banna: Jihad is the Way
**Source:** The Muslim Brotherhood Ideology

## Core Argument
Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, argues that Jihad is not merely a defensive war or a spiritual struggle, but an eternal offensive obligation to establish Allah's law on earth.

## Key Excerpts

**The Obligation:**
"Jihad is an obligation from Allah on every Muslim and cannot be ignored nor evaded. Allah has ascribed great importance to jihad and has made the reward of the martyrs and the fighters in His way a splendid one. Only those who have acted similarly and who have modeled themselves upon the martyrs in their performance of jihad can join them in this reward."

**On the Nature of Jihad:**
"Many Muslims today mistakenly believe that fighting the enemy is *Jihad al-Asghar* (the Lesser Jihad) and that fighting one's soul is *Jihad al-Akbar* (the Greater Jihad). This narration is weak. The truth is that the highest form of Jihad is fighting in the way of Allah with one's life and wealth."

**The Goal:**
"Islam is a comprehensive system which deals with all spheres of life. It is a country and a homeland or a government and a nation. It is conduct and power or mercy and justice. It is a culture and a law or knowledge and jurisprudence. It is material and wealth or gain and prosperity. It is Jihad and a call or army and a cause. And finally, it is true belief and worship."

**The Call to Death:**
"Allah is our objective. The Prophet is our leader. The Quran is our constitution. Jihad is our way. Dying in the way of Allah is our highest hope." (*The Motto of the Muslim Brotherhood*)

**On Colonialism:**
"The lands of Islam have been trampled over by the feet of the unbelievers... It is the duty of every Muslim to rise up and drive them out, not just from their own country, but from every land where the name of Allah is mentioned."
