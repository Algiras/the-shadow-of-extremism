# Ibn Taymiyyah: The Mardin Fatwa
**Source:** Compiled from various translations (Michot, etc.)

## Context
Ibn Taymiyyah was asked about the status of the city of Mardin, which was ruled by Mongols who had converted to Islam but did not implement Sharia law, while the population remained Muslim. Was it *Dar al-Islam* (Abode of Islam) or *Dar al-Harb* (Abode of War)?

## The Ruling (Fatwa)

**Question:**
"Whatever the condition of Mardin, is it a land of war or of peace? Is it obligatory for the Muslim resident there to emigrate? If he does not emigrate, is he a sinner? And is it lawful to give aid to its enemies?"

**Answer:**
"The blood and property of the Muslims are inviolable, whether they are in Mardin or elsewhere. Assistance to those who act in opposition to the Law of Islam is unlawful, whether they are the people of Mardin or others. The people living there, if they are unable to practice their religion, must emigrate. If they are able to practice it, emigration is not obligatory but remains desirable."

**On the Status of the Territory:**
"As for the status of the land, it is neither strictly a *Dar al-Islam* (where the laws of Islam are applied) nor a *Dar al-Harb* (where the inhabitants are unbelievers). It is a third type of domain (*Dar Murakkab* - Composite Domain). The Muslims therein should be treated according to what they deserve, and the outsiders (Mongol rulers) who deviate from the Sharia should be fought as they deserve."

## Significance
This fatwa broke the traditional binary of Islamic international law. It allowed for a nuanced approach to territories where Muslims lived under non-Islamic or "impure" rule. However, modern extremists (like Al-Qaeda and ISIS) have reinterpreted this to justify declaring war on Muslim-majority states that do not apply their strict version of Sharia, arguing that such rulers are "Mongols" of the modern age.
