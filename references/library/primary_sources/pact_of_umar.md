# The Pact of Umar
**Source:** Traditional Islamic Jurisprudence (attributed to Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, likely 9th Century)

**In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.**

This is a document to the servant of Allah, `Umar, the Leader of the faithful, from the Christians of such and such a city.

When you came against us, we requested safety (*aman*) for ourselves, our children, our property, and the followers of our religion. We made the following conditions upon ourselves in return for this safety and protection:

1.  We will neither erect in our areas a new monastery, church, convent, or a monk's cell, nor restore any place of worship that needs restoration, nor use any of them for the purpose of enmity against Muslims.
2.  We will not prevent any Muslim from resting in our churches whether they come by day or night, and we will open the doors of our houses of worship for the wayfarer and passerby.
3.  Those Muslims who come as guests will enjoy boarding and food for three days.
4.  We will not allow a spy against Muslims into our churches and homes or hide deceit or betrayal against Muslims.
5.  We will not teach our children the Qur'an.
6.  We will not publicize practices of *Shirk* (polytheism), invite anyone to *Shirk*, or prevent any of our fellows from embracing Islam if they choose to do so.
7.  We will respect Muslims and move from the places in which we sit if they choose to sit in them.
8.  We will not imitate their clothing, caps, turbans, sandals, hairstyles, speech, nicknames, and title names.
9.  We will not ride on saddles, hang swords on our shoulders, collect weapons of any kind, or carry these weapons.
10. We will not encrypt our stamps in Arabic.
11. We will not sell liquor.
12. We will have the front of our hair cut.
13. We will wear our customary clothes wherever we are and wear belts around our waist (*zunnar*).
14. We will refrain from erecting crosses on the outside of our churches or demonstrating them and our books in public in Muslim fairways and markets.
15. We will not sound the bells in our churches, except discreetly (softly).
16. We will not raise our voices while reciting our holy books inside our churches in the presence of Muslims.
17. We will not raise our voices with prayer at our funerals or light torches in funeral processions in the fairways of Muslims or in their markets.
18. We will not bury our dead next to Muslim dead.
19. We will not buy servants who were captured by Muslims.
20. We will be guides for Muslims and refrain from breaching their privacy in their homes.
21. We will not beat any Muslim.

These are the conditions that we set against ourselves and followers of our religion in return for safety and protection. If we break any of these promises that we set for your benefit against ourselves, then our *Dhimmah* (promise of protection) is broken, and you are allowed to do with us what you are allowed of people of defiance and rebellion.
