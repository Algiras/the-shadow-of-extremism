# Research Notes: History of Islam & Extremism

## 1. History of Islam: Brief Overview
- **Origins**: 7th Century CE, Arabian Peninsula. Prophet Muhammad (570-632 CE) received revelations (Quran).
- **Key Periods**:
    - **Rashidun Caliphate (632-661)**: "Rightly Guided Caliphs". Expansion into Persia, Syria, Egypt.
    - **Umayyad Caliphate (661-750)**: Capital in Damascus. Expansion to Spain and India.
    - **Abbasid Caliphate (750-1258)**: "Golden Age". Capital in Baghdad. Science, philosophy, culture flourished. Ended with Mongol invasion.
    - **Ottoman Empire (1299-1922)**: Capital in Istanbul (1453). Major power in Europe/Asia/Africa.
    - **Modern Era (20th Century-Present)**: Nation-states, post-colonialism, rise of political Islam.

## 2. Extremist Views & Ideologies
- **Roots**:
    - **Wahhabism (18th C.)**: Puritanical movement by Ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Rejection of "innovations" (bid'a). Strict literalism.
    - **Salafism (19th C.)**: Revivalist movement seeking return to "pious predecessors" (Salaf). Spectrum from quietist to jihadist.
    - **Jihadism**: Modern militant ideology. Use of violence to establish Islamic state.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **Tawhid**: Absolute oneness of God (extremists use this to label others as polytheists).
    - **Takfir**: Excommunication of other Muslims (declaring them apostates).
    - **Al-Wala' wa-l-Bara'**: Loyalty to Muslims and disavowal/hatred of non-believers.

## 3. Treatment of Non-Believers
- **Historical Context (Dhimmi System)**:
    - "People of the Book" (Christians, Jews) granted protection and autonomy in exchange for tax (Jizya).
    - Second-class status but generally tolerated compared to contemporary Europe.
- **Modern Extremist Views**:
    - Rejection of coexistence.
    - Non-believers viewed as enemies ("Kuffar").
    - Justification of violence, enslavement (e.g., ISIS treatment of Yazidis), and subjugation.
    - Goal of global Caliphate with strict Sharia enforcement.

## 4. Rights of Women & Children
- **Traditional Islam**:
    - Spiritual equality. Rights to property, inheritance, education, marriage consent.
    - Patriarchal cultural norms often limited these rights (guardianship, segregation).
- **Extremist Oppression**:
    - **Taliban/ISIS**:
        - Ban on education for girls.
        - Exclusion from public life/work.
        - Forced marriage, sexual slavery (ISIS).
        - Draconian dress codes (Burqa) and punishment (stoning, lashing).
    - Justified by selective/distorted reading of texts, ignoring historical context of women's rights.

## 5. Impact on Modern Society
- **Conflict with Western Values**:
    - Rejection of democracy (seen as man-made law vs. God's law).
    - Opposition to freedom of speech (blasphemy laws).
    - Rejection of gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights.
- **Security & Social Impact**:
    - Terrorism (9/11, Europe attacks).
    - Rise of Islamophobia and right-wing extremism in reaction.
    - Challenges to integration and social cohesion.
