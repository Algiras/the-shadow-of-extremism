## 📖 About This Book

An in-depth exploration of religious extremism through the lens of Islamic history, theology, and contemporary politics—while demonstrating that extremism is a universal human phenomenon, not unique to any single faith.

This book traces the arc from Islam's Golden Age through colonial trauma to modern jihadism, using frameworks from psychology, economics, and social science to understand how extremist movements emerge, sustain themselves, and can be countered.

I need reviewers who will:
