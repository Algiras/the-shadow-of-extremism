## The Story

In November 2024, a software engineer wondered: *Could modern AI systems synthesize complex scholarly analysis in record time?*

The answer: **Yes.**

Using free AI tools available to anyone, a 200-page comparative analysis of religious extremism across Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and other traditions was created in **48 hours**.

## Key Stats

- **Timeline**: 2 days (48 hours)
- **Length**: 200+ pages
- **Scope**: 7 religious/ideological movements analyzed
- **Cost**: $0 (free tier AI tools)
- **Primary Tool**: Google Antigravity (Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking)
- **Verification**: Anthropic Claude

## What Makes This Unique

1. **Speed**: Traditional scholarship would require years
2. **Accessibility**: Used only free, publicly available tools
3. **Transparency**: Complete methodology documented
4. **Replicability**: Step-by-step guide provided
5. **Honesty**: Clearly presented as experimental, not claiming traditional expertise
